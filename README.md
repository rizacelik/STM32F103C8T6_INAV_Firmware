Click on the GPS menu to see the map where the GPS gives your location. If the GPS module is started for the first time, it will try to acquire satellites for a long time, about 15 to 20 minutes, so this window may open late. It should also be tested outdoors if possible, or on a window or balcony if not. If no satellite is found indoors, this window will not open again.

You can make autonomous flight by marking the coordinates you want on the map with Mission Control from the Mission Control menu. After determining the coordinates, click the blue Save and Rebot button at the bottom right of the last window to save.

The task definitions for autonomous flight are made in the Modes Menu.
* NAV ALTHOLD - Altitude hold
* NAV POSHOLD - Hold horizontal position
* NAV KURS HOLD - Fixed Wing Steering
* NAV CRUISE - Fixed Wing Direction + Altitude Hold
* NAV RTH - Back home
* NAV WP - Autonomous waypoint mission
* GCS NAV - Ground control station

Channel CH5 is assigned for ARM and HORIZON. You can assign the channel of the switch buttons on the remote here.

NAV POSHOLD position hold. Always check that POSHOLD is working properly before using RTH or starting a WP task. You can assign the channel of the switch buttons on the remote here. CH6 is used in the example.

It allows us to use automatic navigation features such as NAV RTH and NAV WP Tasks. If the signal from CH7 is at the top, let it return home (NAV RTH), and if it is in the middle, let it fulfill the task that we have determined with the coordinates you want with Mission Control (NAV WP).

We can set the flight route according to the coordinates in the Mission Control Menu. Select the first location by clicking on a desired location on the map, the blue icon will appear, click on it and the location information will appear as shown on the side. In the meantime, we enter the height in cm where it says Alt (cm). You should also enter the speed in cm in the area written (cm/s) at the bottom. For example, 100 cm means that it will gain speed of 1 meter per second. Then we save the first position by clicking the Save button, then you can select the second, third, etc. targets in a similar way and enter their heights and speeds in different ways. These set coordinates will be realized with the NAV WP task above. This task occurs when you bring the switch of the CH7 channel on the remote to the middle.

In the Failsafe menu, we set what to do when there is a problem or the drone is out of range, out of range. DROP drop, Land auto land, RTH return home are options.
